# 🩺 MediQ — AI-Powered Medical Report Analyzer

MediQ is a full-stack, AI-powered medical report analysis platform that converts unstructured medical documents (PDFs, scanned images, CSVs) into structured, meaningful, and actionable health insights. It addresses a real-world problem in healthcare: **medical reports are often complex, inconsistent, and difficult for patients and even clinicians to quickly interpret.** MediQ bridges this gap by combining intelligent extraction, AI-driven analysis, and a clean user interface to make medical data more accessible and usable.

Built during the **Infosys Virtual Internship**, this project demonstrates end-to-end system design, backend engineering, frontend UX, AI integration, and workflow optimization.


## 🎯 Problem Statement

In real healthcare environments:

- Medical reports come in different formats (PDFs, scanned images, CSV exports).
- Important biomarkers and values are buried in long documents.
- Patients struggle to understand reports.
- Doctors and labs lack simple tools to quickly visualize and summarize data.

**The core problem MediQ solves:**

👉 Making medical reports **machine-readable, human-friendly, and insight-driven**.


## 💡 Motivation & Inspiration

This project was inspired by:
- Observing how difficult it is for non-technical users to understand medical reports.
- The need for digital transformation in healthcare documentation.
- Internship exposure to system design and workflow automation challenges.

I built MediQ to:
- Apply full-stack development skills in a meaningful healthcare use case.
- Explore AI integration in real applications.
- Design a complete, production-style system rather than a toy project.


## 🧑‍💻 My Contributions

I took ownership of the entire system design and implementation, including:

### Backend Engineering
- Designed RESTful APIs using Flask.
- Implemented multi-format file ingestion (PDF, Image, CSV).
- Built a **smart extraction router** that automatically chooses the appropriate extractor:
  - PDF parsing
  - OCR pipeline for scanned images
  - CSV parsing logic
- Integrated an AI analysis engine with fallback logic.
- Implemented risk scoring, abnormality detection, confidence metrics, caching, and telemetry.
- Added structured error handling and validation.

### Frontend Development
- Designed a premium UI using React + TypeScript + Tailwind.
- Built:
  - Drag-and-drop upload interface
  - Real-time backend health monitoring
  - Interactive results dashboard
  - Expandable biomarker explanations
  - Trend visualization & alerts
  - History tracking
  - Dark/light mode support

### Workflow & UX Enhancements
- Optimized backend processing flow.
- Added telemetry and an audit trail for traceability.
- Designed a clean user journey from upload → analysis → results → export.

### PDF Report Generation
- Enabled exportable professional summaries for offline sharing with a structured report layout.

## ⚙️ Installation & Setup

Backend:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/vvdmahesh3/MediQ
cd MediQ/backend/api
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate   # Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
python app.py
```

Runs at: `http://127.0.0.1:5000` (local backend API server)

Frontend:

```bash
cd ../frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

Runs at: `http://localhost:5173` (frontend development server)


## ▶️ Usage Guide

1. Upload a medical report (PDF / Image / CSV).
2. Backend validates and extracts text.
3. AI engine analyzes biomarkers and risk.
4. Dashboard displays parameters, health status, confidence scores, and explanations.
5. Export results as PDF if needed.


## ⚠️ Deployment Note

The backend integrates AI models, OCR engines, and heavy processing libraries, which can require significant compute resources. Free hosting platforms (Render, Railway, etc.) impose strict limits on RAM, CPU, build size, and request timeouts.

➡️ Due to these constraints, the backend is demonstrated locally in this repo, while the frontend can be deployed independently. Production-ready deployment options include dedicated cloud instances, Docker/Kubernetes, or paid cloud services (AWS, Azure, GCP).


## 🔮 Future Roadmap

- User authentication & report history
- Secure cloud storage
- Doctor–patient sharing workflow
- Real-time charts for longitudinal tracking
- HIPAA-compliant security layer
- Mobile app version
- Multi-language OCR support
